# Sales Data Analytics Pipeline

## Project Description
This project is a data engineering pipeline designed to automate the process of ingesting, transforming, and analyzing sales data. The goal is to build an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using modern tools and cloud technologies, such as AWS, Snowflake, Python, and Jenkins, to extract actionable insights from sales data.

## Objectives
- Automate the extraction of sales data from various sources (CSV files, APIs).
- Perform data cleaning and transformation using Python.
- Store the processed data in Snowflake for scalable data analytics.
- Build interactive dashboards using Power BI for visualizing sales metrics.
- Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins.

## High-Level Pipeline Outline
1. **Data Ingestion**: Extract data from CSV files and APIs and store it in AWS S3.
2. **Data Processing**: Clean and transform the data using Python.
3. **Data Storage**: Load the processed data into Snowflake.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create dashboards using Power BI to analyze sales metrics.
5. **Automation**: Use Docker and Jenkins to automate the ETL pipeline.
